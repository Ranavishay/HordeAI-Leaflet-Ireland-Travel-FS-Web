# HordeAI-Leaflet-Ireland-Travel-FS-Web
Welcome to HordeAI-Leaflet Ireland Travel FS Web, a Full-Stack Web Application that combines the power of HordeAI for image generation and Leaflet for interactive mapping to help you explore travel destinations in Ireland.

## Overview
This project leverages HordeAI's image generation capabilities to create stunning visual representations of travel destinations across Ireland. With Leaflet integration, users can interactively explore these destinations on a map, making trip planning and exploration more engaging and informative.


## Features
Dynamic Image Generation: Utilizes HordeAI to dynamically generate images for various travel destinations in Ireland based on user-selected trip types (foot, bike, car).
Interactive Mapping: Integrates Leaflet mapping functionality to provide users with an interactive map interface for exploring destinations and planning routes.
Trip Data API: Provides an API endpoint to fetch data about travel destinations in Ireland, including information such as name, location, and description.
Country Data Retrieval: Fetches data about Ireland from an external API, including details like capital, population, area, languages, and currency.

## Technologies Used

- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**: Backend framework for handling server logic and API endpoints.
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**: NoSQL database for storing trip images and other application data.
- **[HordeAI](https://stablehorde.net/api/)**: Artificial intelligence platform for image generation.
- **[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com)**: JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend development technologies for user interface and interaction.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

#### Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

##### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

##### [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Installation
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ranavishay/HordeAI-Leaflet-Ireland-Travel-FS-Web.git
```
```
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd HordeAI-Leaflet-Ireland-Travel-FS-Web/backend
```
```
# Install backend dependencies
npm install
```
```
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd ../frontend
```
```
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
```

### Database Setup

Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine( I run it as Docker image ).

Create a new MongoDB database named tripImagesDB.

## Running the Application
```
# Start the backend server:
cd ../backend
npm start
```
```
# Start the frontend development server:
cd ../frontend
npm start
```
Open your browser and navigate to the frontend port in my case http://localhost:8080 to view the application.

# Usage
- Upon accessing the application, you'll be able to see a map showing various destinations in Ireland based on different trip types (By Foot, By Bike, By Car).
- Click on your location on the map to mark it.
- Select a trip type from the sidebar to view destinations and routes.
- You can also view trip images generated by HordeAI in the index.html .
- The backend server provides APIs for fetching country data and trip data and save the images in the mongoDB if they are not stored there.
